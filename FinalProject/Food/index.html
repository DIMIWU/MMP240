						Sichuan Cuisine
					</h2>
					<p>
						Sichuan Cuisine, namely Sichuan-style dishes, is one of the four great traditional Chinese cuisines. It has a rich repertoire that amalgamates highlights from diverse cooking methods. It is known across the country and across the world for its exceptional way of cooking and superbly pungent and spicy seasonings.
					</p>
					<p>

						As the most unique Chinese cuisine, Sichuan cuisine primarily uses a variety of common ingredients while emphasizing a numbing sensation, spiciness, and aroma. Even in simple poached dishes, one can detect a hint of spiciness. The most well-known dishes include: Shredded Pork in Garlic Sauce, Kung Pao Chicken, Water-Cooked Fish, Water-Cooked Fillets, Sliced Beef/Beef Tripe/Ox Tongue in Chili Sauce, Spicy Deep Fried Chicken, Mapo Tofu, Double Cooked Pork and Dongpo Pork Knuckle, to name a few.
					</p>
					<p>

						Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province where Sichuan cuisine originated, has been declared as one of the world's gastronomy cities by UNESCO.

						Shangdong Cuisine
					</h2>
					<p>
						As one of the four major traditional Chinese cuisines, Shandong cuisine can be divided into Jinan dishes, Jiaodong dishes, Kongfu (family of Kong, the descendant of Confucius) dishes and other regional styles, among which the Jinan dishes are the most exemplary, with over 50 cooking methods. It is fair to say Shandong cuisine enjoys the longest history and most diverse and sophisticated techniques among all regional varieties of Chinese cuisine.
					</p>
					<p>

						It features pure and authentic seasonings, a salty flavor, freshness, tenderness and crispiness, paying attention to light and milky broths, with the former clear and fresh and the latter white and rich.
					</p>

					<p>

						Shandong cuisine emphasizes quality ingredients, using salt to bring out an umami flavor and soup to reinforce it. As far as seasoning is concerned, the pure, salty and fresh taste is most valued, paying full respect for the original flavors of the ingredients. Most dishes use spring onion, ginger and garlic to highlight the flavors.

					</p>

					<p>

						This school of cooking is particularly adept at bao (stir-frying with high temperatures) and ba (braising). Bao involves quick stir-frying in hot oil at high temperatures. Braising involves marinating the ingredients, applying batter and frying both sides until golden, then cooking over low heat so that the liquid is reduced to a creamy consistency.

					<h2>
						Cantonese Cuisine
					</h2>
					<p>
						One of the Eight Culinary Traditions of Chinese Cuisine, Cantonese cuisine, namely Guangdong cuisine, originated in Guangdong Province, with categories like Guangzhou cuisine, Chaozhou cuisine and Dongjiang cuisine, etc., among which the Guangzhou cuisine is most influential.
					</p>
					<p>

						Cantonese cuisine favors the selection of premium materials with an emphasis on the quality and original flavor of the main ingredients. In the light flavors, umami can be found. The style boasts a wide variety and ingenuous deployment of ingredients, beautiful and brightly colored garnishes and decoration as well as an impressive variety of dishes. At the Guangzhou Classic Dish and Dim Sum Exhibition in 1965, altogether 5,457 dishes were presented. The cuisine is adjusted based on the current season: flavors are lighter in summer and autumn and stronger in winter and spring. In addition, a balance between colors, aroma, tastes and presentation is also stressed.
					</p>


					
					<p>
						On December 1, 2014, Shunde in Guangdong won the honor of being listed by UNESCO as a "City of Gastronomy," becoming the second Chinese city with this title. Shunde is also a cradle of Chinese chefs. Chaozhou cuisine, a branch of Cantonese cuisine, has twice participated in the Expo 2012 in Yeosu Korea and Expo 2015 in Milan, to represent the intangible cultural heritage of Chinese culinary art.

					<h2>
						Hunan Cuisine
					</h2>
					<p>
						Hunan cuisine, or "Xiang cuisine," is derived from the Xiaoxiang (the region of "lakes and rivers" in south-central China that more or less corresponds with today's Hunan province) area, is one of the Eight Culinary Traditions of Chinese Cuisine.
					</p>

					<p>

						Hunan cuisine features complicated and delicate preparation process, rich variety of ingredients and a kaleidoscopic range of tastes and diverse dishes and categories. It is known for affordability, the liberal use of oil, deep colors, fresh aromas, spiciness and tender textures. Common cooking techniques include simmering, stewing, smoking, steaming and stir-frying.
					</p>
					<p>

						The theme of Hunan dishes is strong flavors that pique our appetite for rice. Many Hunan natives don't like to eat foods that are too spicy but do so anyway, primarily to eat more rice. For this reason, Hunan cuisine is often paired with rice.
					</p>


					<P>
						Hunan cuisine boasts an impressively long history. Its genesis dates back to the Han Dynasty, when it had already reached a fairly high level of culinary finesse. The taste is predominantly savory, sour and spicy and imparts a distinctive mountainous and rural flavor. Hunan cuisine is mainly made up of dishes from Changsha and Hengyang. The unity between the gustatory and visual perceptions and harmony of colors, the blending of tastes, aromas, presentation and textures are all vital.

					<h2>
						Anhui Cuisine
					</h2>
					<p>
						Anhui cuisine, a.k.a. "Anhui style cuisine" or "Huizhou style," is one of the Eight Culinary Traditions of Chinese Cuisine. It focuses on braising, stewing and steaming rather than frying with high temperatures and stir-frying. It emphasizes oil, colors and heat control. It follows the practice of applying the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine to dietary choices, a feature that differentiates Anhui cuisine from other cuisines.
					</p>
					<p>

						Red braising is a major cooking technique, with "red" representing the color of the sugar, a technique that requires excellent heat control skills. Oil used in cooking is rapeseed oil extracted manually from rapeseed grown by locals. Wood materials are used liberally, such as charcoal for stewing, firewood for quick cooking and tree bark for slow cooking.
					</p>
					<p>

						The geographical and cultural environment of Anhui adds a special dimension to Anhui cuisine. Most notable dishes include: Soft-shelled Turtle Braised With Ham, Red Braised Civet Cat, Tiger Skin Hairy Tofu and Huangshan Stewed Pigeon, etc.
