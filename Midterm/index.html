		The Journey to the West is probably the best-known Chinese novel to the people outside of the Confucian cultural sphere. With its fabulous magical battles starring the lovable short-tempered Wu Kong (Monkey King), The Journey to the West has an immediate appeal that transcends cultural differences. The Journey to the West has entertained many generations in different adaptations and formats, both inside and outside of China, including the anime series titled Dragon Ball Z, which has been popular on American TV.

 

The Journey to the West has its roots in the legends that had sprung up around the Tang Dynasty era Buddhist monk Xuan Zang (or Hsüan-tsang, 596–664) who traveled to India in search of Buddhist scriptures. Buddhism in China had a very active period during the Tang Dynasty era, where about hundred Chinese monks traveled to India to deepen their learning. The Journey to the West, which was anonymously written and first published in 1592, fuses all these monks into one legendary figure of Xuan Zang. The novel seems to have developed through Buddhist priests’ story telling to spread the teaching. Apart from the bare bone fact that Xuan Zang went to India to bring back the Buddhist scripts, the novel is pure fiction and uses the stories of fantasy daemon battles to propagandize Mahayana Buddhism.
